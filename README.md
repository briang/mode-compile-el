# mode-compile.el

This is mode-compile.el v2.29.1 (obtained from
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/yaa/0f02f59399ee6d08c5b72b504318d2d5/raw/82681792a52fac1dee0507da6978c8184f8f985d/mode-compile.el)
and modernised so as to be usable with emacs 27 and later.

The primary reason for doing this was for use with perl. Only minimal
testing had been done, and only with perl.
